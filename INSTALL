The Subversion Ruby bindings
============================

The bindings for Ruby are available from Subversion 1.2 and up. Installation is fairly straight
forward, as long as you meet the requirements of the svn bindings (see the INSTALL/NOTES in
$SVN_SRC_DIR/subversion/bindings/swig).

Be sure to note the requirements for the SWIG version in that file!

The correct way to install the Ruby bindings once you've configured, maked and 
installed subversion is (unfortunately this doesn't seem to be covered in the 
current svn docs):

$ make swig-rb
$ make check-swig-rb (optional, but you probably want to run these tests)
$ make install-swig-rb (as root)

Configuring Collaboa
====================

1.  Copy (or rename) database.yml.sample to database.yml and set up the credentials and 
    other database details you wish

2.  Run the following
    $ RAILS_ENV="production" rake db:schema:load

3.  Run the following: 
    $ RAILS_ENV="production" ruby db/default_content.rb
    to create the minimal default content Collaboa needs to start with.

4.  Start the server
    $ ruby script/server webrick -e production

5.  IMPORTANT! Change your admin password by logging in with:
      Username: admin
      Password: admin
    And go to Admin > Users > edit "admin" (or add a user with admin privileges and delete "admin")

6.  Set up your repository.  Go to Admin > Repositories and create a new repository with a name
    and local filesystem path.  Collaboa will report "Success!" when you enter a valid path.
    Submit and it will show under Current Repositories.

7.  Before you go anywhere else, you should run the following:
    $ ./script/repository_syncer 
    It will default to using your production settings. For options, run it with the --help flag
    
    Collaboa will automatically sync with your repository when it detects a change, but for the 
    first run you want to run this to avoid timeouts in case your repository is fairly
    big.
